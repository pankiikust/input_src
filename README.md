# input_src
a mobile controls made alternative to CAS

input_src is another ContextActionService that focuses on fixing it's horrible controls roblox offers to ContextActionService when turning mobile buttons parameters on, with additional features to run rather than being an inputless service based, input_src's mission is to balance the playability such as turning around while holding buttons.

## No ContextActionService
Get it outta here,,,,,, throw your nasty little service out before everyone gets pissed!!!!! you can't even try to fix it but with input_src, replace that with this and the feel is similar to it, expanding more customizability for your buttons without any struggle of changing everything for your inputs.

# INSTALLATION 
To install input_src for your game, get it from the marketplace or the GitHub page on the release sections, note that there is no Wally support or Rojo as this was written built-in the studio directly, I'm not familiar with those yet and it's only my first step-in module.

Once obtained, place the module in anywhere that client can access, if it's inside a server, you won't be able to find it
